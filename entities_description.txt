This file describes entities implemented for the game

Moves of type <type> deal double damage to entities of type <type>.

N(mu, sigma) represents a normal distribution with mean mu and standard devation sigma.


---Entity A---
Low health, high attack, high attack variance. Can dodge attacks.

Max_Health = 500

--Move 1 (type NA):
Defensive Move. Permanently causes opponents to miss (attacks deal 0 damage) with probability 0.5. Using this move more than once has no effect.

--Move 2 (type B):
Offensive Move. Deals high damage with high variance. Damage ~ N(250, 40)

--Move 3 (type C):
Offensive Move. Deals high damage with high variance. Damage ~ N(250, 40)


---Entity B---
Medium health, medium attack, low attack variance. Its attack is multiplied by variable amount <d>.

Max_Health = 1000

--Move 1 (type NA):
Tactical Move. Store in <d> 1.5 times the current value of <d>; that is: increase the mean of future attacks by 1.5 leaving variance unchanged.

--Move 2 (type B):
Offensive Move. Deals high damage with high variance. Damage ~ N(150, 10)

--Move 3 (type A):
Offensive Move. Deals high damage with high variance. Damage ~ N(150, 10)


---Entity C---
High health, low attack, medium attack variance. May heal itself.

Max_Health = 1500

--Move 1 (type NA):
Defensive Move. Health is increased by amount <(max_health - current_health)/2.0>

--Move 2 (type C):
Offensive Move. Deals low damage with medium variance. Damage ~ N(100, 20)

--Move 3 (type A):
Offensive Move. Deals low damage with medium variance. Damage ~ N(100, 20)
