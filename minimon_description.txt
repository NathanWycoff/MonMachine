This file will describe MiniMon, a game which is meant to be similar to Pokemon but considerably simpler. The purpose is for rapid prototyping of AI meant to play Pokemon-like games.

MiniMon is not playable by humans; instead, learning programs will be informed of the games state and prompted for decisions.

In MiniMon, each player controls an Entity. On each turn, entities make one of three moves. 

Players choose their moves before a turn. During a turn, a coin is flipped to determine which entity executes its move first.

-There are different types of entities, which are described in "entites_description.txt". 
-Moves may be offensive or defensive. 
-Certain moves do additional damage against certain types of entities. 
-Entities start with a variable amount of health, determined by their type. 
-Moves damage is stochastic, but the damage distribution differs for each move.

The game ends when the health of one entity reaches zero or below.
